Overview of inverse model code
-------------------------

This Bayesian inverse model code is based loosely on NOAA CarbonTracker-Lagrange
software (see: https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/carbontracker-lagrange/), but
written in the R programming language. This particular set-up performs an Observing
System Simulation Experiment (OSSE), meaning that a set of "true" emissions are
defined so as to generate synthetic enhancements which serve as the model data,
in hopes of recovering the "true" emissions in the posterior/optimized result.
This framework is equipped with random-normal perturbations in the synthetic data
in order to simulate the presence of model-data mismatch errors in the observations.


Code can be run as-is, provided that the proper input files are supplied. See
config.r file in inversion/ directory for sample naming conventions of input files.

Required input files should be placed in the include/ directory:
  prior_emiss.nc
  prior_uncert.nc
  lonlat_domain.rds
  obs.rds
  background.rds

The following packages must be installed to successfully run the model code:
  "ncdf4"
  "lubridate"
  "geosphere"
  "data.table"

After inputs are supplied, the program may be run from the inversion/ directory.
If running in the R programming environment (R or Rstudio), run by typing 'source("run_all.r")'. (without single quotes)
If running directly from the terminal, run by typing 'Rscript run_all.r'.

  NOTE: input NetCDF files (prior_emiss.nc, prior_uncert.nc, etc) should exist
  in (lon x lat x time) format, with lon/lat values indicating center-of-grid-cell,
  and time values expressed as beginning of time-step in either POSIX time or seconds since R epoch
  (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC).

  obs.rds input file should be formatted as a matrix with 3 columns, where all observation
   datapoints are be concatenated by rows, with the site code in column 1, the
  timestamp in column 2, and data value in column 3. Site code should correspond to
  that site's directory name in the footprints/ directory. Data timestamps should
  correspond to the observation resolution of the inversion (e.g. hourly), denoted in config.r.
  The inversion code does internal processing and filtering of data to match the
  observation time domain, so the supplied file can have any time range of observations.
   see example:
                # SITECODE  OBS TIME (seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00)  OBS VALUE
   (row 1)      # 'site1'          '[t1 number of seconds]'                 'X.XXX'
   (row 2)      # 'site1'          '[t2 number of seconds]'                 'X.XXX'
    (...)       #   ...                       ...                             ...
   (row n)      # 'siteN'          '[tN number of seconds]'                 'X.XXX'

   background.rds should be formatted similarly, but excluding SITECODE column.
   see example:

                 #   BG TIME (seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00)   BG VALUE
    (row 1)      #         '[t1 number of seconds]'                 'X.XXX'
    (row 2)      #         '[t2 number of seconds]'                 'X.XXX'
     (...)       #                    ...                             ...
    (row n)      #         '[tN number of seconds]'                 'X.XXX'



In addition, footprint files must be supplied in the footprints/ directory.
Files should be in NetCDF format with dimensions (lon x lat x time). Source code
is designed to work with files matching output format from STILT-R
(https://uataq.github.io/stilt/).  This inversion code works with files that 
abide by the naming convention where the first 10 characters of the filename indicate
the start time of the footprint in format: YYYYmmddHH (i.e. year, month, day, hour). There
is no required naming convention after 10 characters (the rest of the filename can be
whatever you want).
